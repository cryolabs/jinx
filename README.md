# 🔹 About

# 🔹 Credits
* [Lyxcode](https://youtube.com/c/Lyxcode) for his tutorials (command handler, giveaway system & music system).
* All the peeps inside his [Discord server](https://discord.gg/dkgebRQWrn) from which I learned how to code all the other systems.
* [Spiderjockey02](https://github.com/Spiderjockey02/Discord-Bot) & [DeltaCoderr](https://github.com/DeltaCoderr/KarmaBot)'s READMEs from which I took inspiration.
* Original profile picture artwork taken from [AlphaCoders](https://wall.alphacoders.com/big.php?i=1044272).
* Huge credits to [Alvaa](https://github.com/Allvaa/lavalink-musicbot) and [SudhanPlayz](https://github.com/SudhanPlayz/Discord-MusicBot/), since their repos have helped me understand Erela.js better than the actual docs.
