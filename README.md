# 🔹 About
Jinx is a learning project for me and also an open-source Discord Bot coded using JavaScript with [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org) and with the help of tutorials made by [Lyxcode](https://www.youtube.com/c/Lyxcode).

# 🔹 Features
* 🎉 **Giveaway**: `giveaway start`, `giveaway actions (end, pause, unpause, reroll, delete)`.
* 🎧 **Music**: `music play`, `music volume`, `music settings (view queue, skip, pause, resume, stop, shuffle, autoplay, relatedsong, repeat)`.
* 🛠️ **Utilities**: `userinfo`, `maintenancemode`, `serverinfo`.
* 📦 **Miscellaneous**: `status`.
* 📷 **Fun**: `image (triggered, shit, wasted, rainbow, rip, sepia, slap)`, `activity`.

# 🔹 Installation
You can find the installation guide [here.](https://github.com/notscrappie/jinx/blob/master/docs/install.md)

# 🔹 Credits
* [Lyxcode](https://youtube.com/c/Lyxcode) for his tutorials (command handler, giveaway system & music system).
* All the peeps inside his [Discord server](https://discord.gg/dkgebRQWrn) from which I learned how to code all the other systems.
* [Spiderjockey02](https://github.com/Spiderjockey02/Discord-Bot) & [DeltaCoderr](https://github.com/DeltaCoderr/KarmaBot)'s READMEs from which I took inspiration.
